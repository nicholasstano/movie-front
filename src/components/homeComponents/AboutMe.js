                <p>Welcome to the main page of my site. The other tabs have reviews I write upon consuming media. The media I enjoy consuming are albums, board games, books, movies, television shows, and video games. Maybe one day I'll look back and think about what I thought about the movie Parasite when it came out. Maybe I won't care? Time will tell. I have included my favorite media for each type below. </p>
