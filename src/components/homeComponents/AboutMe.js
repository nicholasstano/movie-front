            <h1 className="font-weight-light">About Me</h1>
            <p>I attended the College of Mount Saint Vincent and received a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Secondary Education. I began teaching in NYC Charter Schools where I taught for eight and a half years. I completed my Master's Degree in Mathematics while teaching. I enjoy learning and attended Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Program with focus on JavaScript, React, Rails, SQL, and more. I was curious how fantasy draft sites worked and built out a site that allowed users to draft a team. Later I wanted to know how sports site update when games have been played and built out a site for Quidditch that updated player and team statistics upon a user viewing the game results. I am looking to continue growing as a Developer and use my prior experiences in teaching in the tech field.</p>
            <h1 className="font-weight-light">About the Site</h1>
            <p>I enjoy the six media types on the site and will keep my positive notes and notes on what could be better each time I revisit media. If you want to discuss any of the media more in depth I would love to know what you are thinking.</p>
            <p>Below are my current favorites of all time.</p>
