I began learning JavaScript on my own and attended Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program. I love learning and know certain technologies but wish I knew even more. I am currently open to new opportunities in Full Stack Development.</p>

                <p>Welcome to my site where I write reviews when I consume the following media albums, board games, books, movies, tv shows, and video games. One day I may look back and see what I thought of certain things five years ago and see if my opinion has changed. If you want to talk about any media you love or think I would love let's do it.</p>
